Task Board Application

Description
The Task Board application is designed to help project teams efficiently manage their tasks. This web-based application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Users can add, edit, delete, and organize tasks into columns that represent different stages of progress (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed). The app also integrates the Day.js library for date handling and supports drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns.
